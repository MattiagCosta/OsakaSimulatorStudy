# Info

In this repository you can find the tools I used to study the Osaka Simulator Standalone version, in particular the tsu_han.dat save file.

Inside *./Research-Standalone/* you can find some notes if you search good enough. There might be some in *Old/* and *tsu_han_dat/tsu_han_dat-other/*.

I also made a small website to customize a tsu_han.dat file you can then place in your game folder.
