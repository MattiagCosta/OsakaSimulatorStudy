In a fresh tsu_han-hex_converted.txt, 31 and 32 means 1 and 2. They have been changed in tsu_han-final.txt.

It looks like numbers are saved in the little-endian format (the bytes get inverted).
This can be seen for the yens and the flags for the items you can buy (01000000 becomes 00000001, which makes more sense).

If you add new lines or extra character at the end of tsu_han.dat, the yens will change.
Even changing the junk that divides two items changes the yens.
The file gets fixed when the game saves.

I tried to manually change a flag of an item, but Osaka Simulator terminates with an unexpected error: and tsu_han.dat doesn't get fixed.
Maybe because I manually copy-pasted a character that my IDE uses to render a x01 char, and not the actual x01 char. Even when I fixed it by copying a x00 character, the same error occoured.
Changing the byte from 00 to 01 using the proper tools works.

Changing the number of yen is easier and possible.
The yen limit is 100,000,000.

I later tried to change the byte of a "items separator" from 08 to 0b and it still crushed. Looks like these can't be changed.
